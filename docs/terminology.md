| Lot       | The smallest occupiable piece of land.         | Burial Site                   |

For example in the context of a cemetery system, John Doe has passed away and has been interred.

-   John Doe would be considered an **occupant**.
-   An **occupancy** record would be created with **no end date** and associated with his **burial site (lot)** of choice.
-   The **burial site (lot)** is associated with the **cemetery (map)** where John is buried.

For example in the context of a marina, Jane Smith and her boat are renting a slip for a week.

-   Jane Smith, and possibly the others on her boat, would be considered **renters (occupants)**.
-   A **reservation (occupancy)** record would be created for the duration of her stay, and associated with the **slip (lot)** of choice.
-   The **slip (lot)** is associated with the **marina (map)** where the slip is located.
