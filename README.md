# Lot Occupancy System

A system for managing the occupancy of lots.

Built with **cemetery management** in mind, but flexible enough to handle marinas and campgrounds as well.

## Key Features

**Maps are optional!**<br />
Many systems of this type start with a map, and drill down into the data from it.
This can result in a huge amount of effort to get started.
This system can run "out-of-the-box" without maps, with the option to add them when it makes sense.
